# Stanford Machine Learning

Repository contains Octave code for Assignments from Andrew NG's Machine Learning Course.

### About the Course
This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: 
<ol>
<li> Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks).</li>
<li> Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). </li>
<li> Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI).</li>
</ol>
The course also draws from numerous case studies and applications, it teaches the learner to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.
